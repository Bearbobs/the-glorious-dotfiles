## Fonts
+ **Google Sans**
+ **San Francisco Display**

## Installation
+ **Install the dependencies.**
+ Copy the selected theme from `Glorious-Dotfiles/config/awesome` to `$HOME/.config/`
+ Rename it to `awesome`
+ Reload Awesome using `Super + shift + r`


## Basic File Structure
Each setup is split in multiple parts:
+ `Configuration` is about all the settings available
+ `Layout` hold the disposition of all the widgets
+ `Module` contain all the features available
+ `Theme` hold all the aesthetic aspects
+ `Widget` contain all the widgets available
+ `Binaries` contains all the bash script wrapped in lua and AwesomeWM API


## Where to edit this and that?
+ Aesthetics?
  - Go to `awesome/theme`
  - Then check the `default-theme.lua` and *`setupname`*`-theme\init.lua` files
+ Panels and bars?
  - `awesome/layout`
+ Client behaviour?
  - `awesome/module/decorate-client.lua`
  - `awesome/module/titlebar-decorate-client.lua`
+ Start-up Applications?
  - `awesome/configuration/apps.lua`
+ Keybindings?
  - `awesome/configuration/client/keys/`
+ Client rules?
  - `awesome/configuration/client/rules.lua`
+ Compositor?
  -  `awesome/configuration/picom.conf`
+ Rofi?
  - `awesome/configuration/rofi/`
+ Tags?
  - `awesome/configuration/tags/`
+ Icons?
  - `awesome/theme/icons/`
+ Wallpapers?
  - `awesome/theme/wallpapers/`
+ Modules?
  - `awesome/modules`
+ Binaries?
  - `awesome/binaries`
+ Hotel?
  - `Trivago`


## NOTE
+ This setup will not mostly work out of the box because:
  - **YOU'RE NOT USING [`awesome - git master branch`](https://github.com/awesomeWM/awesome/tree/master) version**
  - It is only tested and configured on a 1366x768 resolution (Lenovo x230)
  - Some dependencies are not currently installed
  - Not tested in a multi-monitor setup (please send me an extra monitor so I can test it lol)
+ Check keybindings using `Super +  F1`
+ Anti-aliased titlebars
  - You can also add an anti-aliased titlebars in these setups thanks to the well-documented dotfiles of [elenepan](https://github.com/elenapan/dotfiles). 

  *Anti-aliasing can be applied to any wibox by making its background color transparent and putting all its items in a shaped container with the desired background color.*

  - Here is an example of an anti-aliased titlebar:
    ```lua
      awful.titlebar(c, {position = 'left', size = title_bar_size, bg = "#00000000"}) : setup {
      {   
        {
          awful.titlebar.widget.closebutton    (c),
          awful.titlebar.widget.maximizedbutton(c),
          awful.titlebar.widget.minimizebutton (c),
          layout  = wibox.layout.fixed.vertical
        },
        {
          buttons = buttons,
          layout  = wibox.layout.flex.vertical
        },
        { 
          awful.titlebar.widget.floatingbutton (c),
          layout = wibox.layout.fixed.vertical
        },
      layout = wibox.layout.align.vertical,
    },
    -- We'll use this as the titlebar's BG
    bg = "#000000",
    -- Shape of the left titlebar
    shape = function(cr, width, height)
      gears.shape.partially_rounded_rect(cr, width, height, true, false, false, true, dpi(9)) end,
    widget = wibox.container.background
    }
    ```

  - You can use the snippet above and tweak it. It is also better if you add an empty right titlebar.

## ABOUT WIDGETS AND MODULES
+ Music Widget:
  - You need a song with hard-coded album cover for music widget to display its cover.
+ Backdrop effect or the blurring of modals/dialogs background:
  - Toggle the backdrop effect by setting the `drawBackdrop` to **true/false** in rules or by adding/removing a comment of this module in `rc.lua`.
+ Weather and email widget:
 - Credentials required.
+ Menu module:
  - Using `xdg-menu`. Requires manual intervention to generate a list of application. Instruction:
    - Install `xdg-menu`. In Arch, it is called `archlinux-xdg-menu` It generates a list of applications installed.
    - Execute `xdg_menu --format awesome --root-menu /etc/xdg/menus/arch-applications.menu >~/.config/awesome/archmenu.lua` to generate a list to archmenu.lua
    - You can just substitute its values to `awesome/module/menu.lua`
  - Using `awesome-freedesktop`. Automatically generates a list of application:  
    - Install `awesome-freedesktop`. In Arch's AUR, it is called `awesome-freedesktop-git` It generates a list of applications installed. Or better yet check the repo [here](https://github.com/lcpz/awesome-freedesktop).
    - You can change the icon theme in `awesome/theme/default-theme.lua`. Search for `theme.icon_theme`
+ I have created a repository for the widgets I have wrote while creating these setups. Right now, the repo only has the `dynamic wallpaper` widget. It changes wallpaper based on time. My next target is the notification center. Check it out [here](https://github.com/ilovecookieee/awesome-glorious-widgets).
